-- Insert a default admin profile (this will need to be manually updated after first admin signs up)
-- Note: This is a placeholder. The first user to sign up should have their role updated to 'admin' manually

-- You can run this query after the first user signs up to make them an admin:
-- UPDATE public.profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
